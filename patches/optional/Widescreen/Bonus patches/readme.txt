
After you apply the widescreen patch v0.3.07, you have the chance to apply two optional patches.

One is Display the entire blue map.ips patch
If you want to have all the complete maps from the beginning, including all the secret rooms.
Is this too easy for you?, because there will be no more secret rooms for you!
I leave this decision to you.

The second is Store Shinespark v1.01.ips patch
You can now store a shinespark for later use if you charge two consecutive shinesparks, only execute the second charge before the time of the first one ends. Now wait until the time of the second charge expires, you've done it, you has stored a shinespark for later use. You can use it in the same room or in other rooms that you arrive at later. I would have liked that this game had brought an option like this when it came out back in its day.

Here you can watch a video with the patch in action:
