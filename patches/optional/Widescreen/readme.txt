Super Metroid Redux v1.5 - Widescreen Patch v0.3.07 by ocesse

This folder contains a patch and a setting overrides file for Super Metroid Redux v1.5 (UH), (CRC32: 72FF6507).

Soft patch:
Be sure that your game, the Widescreen bps patch and the bso override file have the same name, for example:
Super Metroid Redux v1.5 - WS.smc (CRC32: 72FF6507)
Super Metroid Redux v1.5 - WS.bps
Super Metroid Redux v1.5 - WS.bso
Put only the three files in the same folder and open your smc game with bsnes_hd.exe

Hard patch:
Or apply the Widescreen ips patch to Super Metroid Redux v1.5 (UH) with an ips patcher like Flips and rename it the same as the bso override file, for example:
Super Metroid Redux v1.5 - WS Patched.smc (CRC32: 00C83157)
Super Metroid Redux v1.5 - WS Patched.bso
Put only the two files in the same folder and open your smc game with bsnes_hd.exe

And after you hard patched your game, you can use one or the two bonus patches

The RetroArch core bsnes-hd now support softpatch and the bso override file.
