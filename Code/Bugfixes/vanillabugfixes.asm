;note: many of these bugfixes have already been included in other patches.
;these are organized from low address to high address.

;todo: 1) continue searching through metconst discord for relevant mentions of the word "bug",
;12-22-21 to 5-3-22 have all been searched so far
;2) look through all vanilla bugfix patches on both new and old site and forums and add to this
;3) look through metconst discord for other things like "error" and add to this
;4) go through bank logs, look for any other mentions of bugs/errors
;also add a separate section for bugs with known fixes for which the fix would not be an objective improvement
;5) also add maybe small improvements like reserves coming full

;Routine: $86B6B9 (eye door projectile pre-instruction)
;Bug: Crash after 100h+ frames if you kill eye door on same frame eye door projectile spawns
;Fix by PJBoy from https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=492
{
;  BUG: the $B707 branch assumes the enemy projectile index is in X, but this is only true if the branch on $B6BC/C1 is taken,
;  otherwise the enemy projectile index is in Y, and the door bit array index is in X,
;  causing misaligned writes to enemy projectile RAM if X is odd, eventually causing a crash when the garbage instruction pointer gets executed
;  (which happens after a delay of 100h+ frames due to the misaligned write to the instruction time

;  The fix here is setting the X register to the enemy projectile index,
;  which can be done without free space due to an unnecessary RTS in the original code

;Fix by Nodever2 from https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=494
{
;  this is somewhat difficult to explain and I've already covered it before but basically
;  the game improperly handles the addition to samus' Y velocity when she has speed booster.
;  this is most noticeable when jumping with speed booster without high jump.

;Routine: $91D9B2 (load blue suit palette)
;Bug: Samus' suit flashes glitchy colors if transitioning to blue suit palette from screw attack palette.
;Fix by Nodever2: Move check for out of bounds to before using the value
{
;  Cause: LDA $0ACE at $91DA89 doesn't check if index is out of bounds first.
;  This routine normally checks if it's out of bounds after running and corrects it for the next iteration,
;  but since screw attack tables also use $0ACE as an index and those have longer tables,
;  going from screw to speed can cause $0ACE to be too high and cause this index out of bounds issue.
